### **Task 2: Bypassing Ransomware**
- **Objective**: Write a **Python script** to brute-force the decryption key of a ransomware-encrypted ZIP file.
- **Steps**:
  1. Used the provided **`bruteforce.py`** template and **Rockyou wordlist**.
  2. Implemented a **brute-force attack** to test passwords from the wordlist.
  3. Successfully decrypted the **ZIP file** and extracted its contents.
  4. Opened the extracted **Word document** and pasted the Python script inside.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - **Python scripting** for ethical hacking.
  - Understanding **brute-force attacks** and password security.
  - **Hands-on experience** with cybersecurity incident response.
